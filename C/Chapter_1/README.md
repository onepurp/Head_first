## Comprehensive exercise for Chapter 1

This exercise will help me apply what I have learned and build a basic C program

### Create a Simple Calculator

Write a C program that acts as a basic calculator. It should:

1. Display a menu to the user with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Prompt the user to select an operation.
3. Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
4. Perform the selected operation on the two numbers.
5. Display the result to the user.


Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Display a menu:
```
Simple Calculator Menu:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Quit
```
2. Ask the user to select an operation by entering a number (e.g., 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).

3. Depending on the user's choice, prompt them to enter two numbers (you can use `scanf` for input).

4. Perform the selected operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and store the result in a variable.

5. Display the result to the user.

6. If the user selects "Quit," exit the program. Otherwise, allow them to perform another calculation.
